**Thoughtform Garden** is an experimental, browser-based coding environment that merges a personal knowledge base with a functional IDE. It is an "editor-first OS" that lives entirely in your browser, designed to explore literate programming, build self-improving code, and collaborate with AI agents.

## Core Technologies
- **[CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/)**: A modern, extensible in-browser code editor that provides the core text-editing experience.
- **[isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/)**: A pure JavaScript implementation of git that creates a complete virtual filesystem within the browser's IndexedDB.
- **[Eruda](https://eruda.liriliri.io/)**: An embedded developer console that provides mobile-friendly debugging tools for both human and AI developers.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation front-end tooling system that provides a fast and lean development experience.

## The Vision
This project explores what happens when your development tool is also a malleable, agentic knowledge graph. The system is designed to be a "digital garden" where ideas (Thoughtforms) can be cultivated, connected, and grown into complex systems by a collective intelligence (an Egregore) of humans and AI.

## Roadmap
The current editor is the foundation. The future is focused on building a fully ambient, multi-modal computing experience.

-   **LLM Integration**: Enable high-level, conversational coding and recursive self-improvement.
-   **URL-Based Programming**: Turn functionality into shareable links (`?write`, `?prompt`).
-   **QR Code "Skills"**: Allow agents (physical or virtual) to acquire new skills by "looking" at a QR code.
-   **Device Swarms**: Use WebRTC to create ad-hoc, multi-device computing clusters.
-   **Visual & Multimodal Editing**: Move beyond text to include node-based graph editors and viewers for different media types.
