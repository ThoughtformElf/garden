# YOUR TASK
You must now decide the next step.
1.  **Thought:** Look at the CURRENT STATE, especially the original `USER GOAL`. Compare it to the last `OBSERVATION`. What piece of information is missing? Which tool from the `AVAILABLE TOOLS` list will help you get that information? Formulate a clear plan for your next single step.
2.  **Action:** Based on your thought, choose one tool from the `AVAILABLE TOOLS` list to execute.

If, and only if, the `OBSERVATION` in the `CURRENT STATE` contains enough information to fully answer the `USER GOAL`, you should use the `finish` tool.

Respond with a single, valid JSON object following this exact format:
{
  "thought": "...",
  "action": {
    "tool": "...",
    "args": { ... }
  }
